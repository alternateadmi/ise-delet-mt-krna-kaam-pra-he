# Git Commands Guide for Learners

This file lists the most common Git commands, organized by their function.

## 🚀 Getting Started & Setup

These commands are for setting up Git for the first time or starting a new project.

* `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

  * Sets the name that will be attached to your commits. This is a **one-time setup** on any new machine.

  * Sets the email that will be attached to your commits. Also a **one-time setup**.

* `git init`

  * Initializes (creates) a new, empty Git repository in your current folder. This is the first step to creating a new project.

* `git clone <url>`

  * Downloads a copy (a "clone") of an existing repository from a remote URL (like GitHub) to your local machine.

## 🔐 SSH Key Setup (for GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

These commands let you connect to GitHub without typing your password every time.

* `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"`

  * Generates a new SSH key for secure authentication.

* `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`

  * Starts the SSH authentication agent.

* `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
